# How I Roll
This app is "How I Roll". It's a web app that can simulate dice rolls.

## `v0.0` Functionality
At the moment, there is little to no functionality. However, one can get a local build running by following these steps:
1. fork or clone this repository.
1. `cd` into project directory within a new terminal instance.
1. run `go run ./go/main.go` in terminal.

These steps will at least get you up and running for development implementations.
